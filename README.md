# Morse Trainer

A little (probably terrible) application to learn morse code.

## Getting Started

You can find the apk for android in the 'apk' folder. If you download it, you need to authorize the installation of applications from "unknown" sources.

## Description

The application offers several modes :
* ***Learning mode :*** In this mode you can find all letters in the alphabet, with the corresponding morse code. You can click on a letter to hear it played.
* ***Decode letter mode :*** Listen to morse code and chose what is the letter (TODO)
* ***Encode letter mode :*** Find the code for a letter (TODO)
* ***Decode word mode :*** Listen to a full word in morse code and write the word (TODO)
* Other ideas are coming ! Stay tuned :)
