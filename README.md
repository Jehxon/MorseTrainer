# Morse Trainer

A little application to learn morse code.

## Getting Started

You can find the apk for android in the 'apk' folder. If you download it, you need to authorize the installation of applications from "unknown" sources.

## Description

The application offers several modes :
* ***Learning mode :*** In this mode you can find all letters in the alphabet, with the corresponding morse code. You can click on a letter to hear it played.
* ***Decode letter mode :*** Listen to morse code and chose what is the letter
* ***Encode letter mode :*** Find the code for a letter
* ***Decode word mode :*** Listen to a full word in morse code and write the word
* Other ideas are coming ! Stay tuned :)

## Known issues

* Slower playback speed are buggy. When setting the playback speed to low value like 0.5, long letters ending with a dot are not played entirely (H for exemple).
* At high playback rate, the first time playing a word some letters overlap and the result is not audible (and really unpleasant).

If you have any ideas on how to correct these issues please let me know !
